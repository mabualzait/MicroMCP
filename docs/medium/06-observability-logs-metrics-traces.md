## Observability that Matters: Logs, Metrics, Traces for Micro‑MCP

By Malik Abualzait

### What to observe

- Gateway: auth decisions, policy results, routing, latency/error
- Services: method execution time, IO sizes, domain errors
- End‑to‑end: request correlation across hops

### Logs

- Structured JSON; redaction for PII; no secrets
- Gateway audit: ts, principal, method, decision, latency, result

### Metrics

- Per namespace: QPS, p50/p95 latency, error rates
- Resource sizes: request/response bytes

### Traces

- Propagate correlation IDs; adopt OpenTelemetry
- Spans: client→gateway, gateway→service, service work

### Pipeline

- Collect → transform (redact) → store → alert → dashboards

### Checklist

```text
- [ ] Structured logs + redaction
- [ ] Per-namespace metrics + SLIs
- [ ] Distributed tracing enabled
- [ ] Alerts for error rate/latency/denies
```
