## Governance, Compliance, and Supply Chain for Enterprise MCP

By Malik Abualzait

### Governance

- Capability review: namespacing, schema quality, security posture
- Change control: semver, deprecations, rollout plans
- Ownership: service owners, oncall, SLOs

### Compliance

- Audit trails: retention and integrity; access review
- Data governance: classification tags, redaction rules
- Consent and purpose binding for sensitive tools

### Supply chain

- SBOMs, signatures, provenance (SLSA); policy to admit only verified images
- Secrets management; no hardâ€‘coded or logged secrets
- Vulnerability scans; patch cadence per severity

### Organizational patterns
